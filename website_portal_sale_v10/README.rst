Website Portal for Sales (Backported From v10)
==============================================

This module replaces some functionality of ``website_portal_sale`` to support
changes introduced in ``website_portal_v10``. See README of
``website_portal_v10`` about rationale for this module and some useful
warnings.

Installation
------------











This will be automatically installed when both ``website_portal_sale`` and
``website_portal_v10`` are found in your system.

Configuration
-------------










Usage
-----












=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to `your website </>`_.
#. Go to `your account </my/home>`_.
#. There you will find the links for your sale documents, in independent
   controllers.
#. Enjoy the new layout.

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------











* This module should be getting updates from time to time, given that at
  backporting time, Odoo 10.0 is not yet even in the beta phase.
* Any module you base on this will need to be updated to be based on
  ``website_portal_sale`` when you migrate it to Odoo 10.0, because this module
  is only intended to replace that during the 9.0 lifespan.
* Backport had to be modified to avoid conflicts betweeen current and v10
  versions of modules, so backport updates would be a bit harder than expected.

Bug Tracker
-----------











Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/website/issues>`_.

If you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and
