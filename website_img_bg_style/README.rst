Snippet Background Style

This module was written to extend the functionality of the website editor to
support choosing more options when setting a background image to any element.

Available choices are under these categories:

* `Position
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position>`_.
* `Repeat
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat>`_.
* `Size
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size>`_.

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------







* Right now you can only select one style for every snippet. To fix that we
  would need to base this module in *website_less*, whose source code is not
  available in OCA. In version 9.0 this will be fixed, but in version 8.0 you
  will have to use only one option or set the correct CSS classes using the
  HTML editor.
